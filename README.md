# Hover Pad Toolkit


Welcome! Here you'll find all the documentation and files needed to rebuild our innovative Hover Pad system from scratch. If you find anything missing or need help, please feel free to contact [__us__](https://www.uni-ulm.de/en/in/mi/mi-mitarbeiter/js.html).

The Hover Pad's crane construction allows controlling the position and angle of a tablet computer in space above an (optional) interactive surface. Therefor we designed the Hover Pad toolkit that enables exploring five degrees of freedom of self-actuated and autonomous displays and the developed control and interaction techniques. 

## Documentation

For further information please visit our [__website__](http://www.uni-ulm.de/?Hover-Pad) or read our [__documentation__](https://github.com/MHCI/HoverPad/tree/master/Documentation).

## Software Toolkit

The [__Software Toolkit__](https://github.com/MHCI/HoverPad/tree/master/Software) is necessary to control the tablet's motion in space and is organized as follows:

* [__Tablet:__](https://github.com/MHCI/HoverPad/tree/master/Software/Tablet) communication libraries and example demo application 
* [__Surface:__](https://github.com/MHCI/HoverPad/tree/master/Software/Surface) server application, communication libraries and example demo application 
* [__Controller:__](https://github.com/MHCI/HoverPad/tree/master/Software/Controller) arduino motor controller 


## Hardware Toolkit

The [__Hardware Toolkit__](https://github.com/MHCI/HoverPad/tree/master/Hardware) contains 3D CAD files and construction information and is organized as follows:

* [__Cranesystem:__](https://github.com/MHCI/HoverPad/tree/master/Hardware/Cranesystem) construction plans for the whole Hover Pad system 
* [__Tablet Holder:__](https://github.com/MHCI/HoverPad/tree/master/Hardware/Tablet%20Holder) circuit diagrams and construction plans for the tablet
